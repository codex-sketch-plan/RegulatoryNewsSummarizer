# Regulatory News Summarizer

### Concept: 
Write a script that automatically scans a few trusted sources (like government websites or specific legal news outlets) for updates on a particular regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act). When it finds a new article or press release, it uses an LLM API to generate a one-paragraph summary and sends it to you via email or a chat message.
